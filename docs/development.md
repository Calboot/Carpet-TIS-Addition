# Development

Current main development mc version: **1.15.2** (The same as `versions/mainProject`)

Thanks to [preprocessor](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor) we have the ability to maintain all supported MC version in a single branch

Common branches usages:

- `master`: stable, release version, and the preferred target for PRs
- `dev`: feature development
- `future`: snapshot migration

master branches usually only receives doc updates directly

Try not to affect version compatibility unless it's necessary

The English doc and the Chinese doc are aligned line by line btw
